/**
 * @file ComputeGraph.cuh
 * @brief Defines the ComputeGraph class for constructing and managing computational graphs in neural network models.
 *
 * This header file defines the `ComputeGraph` class, which serves as the backbone for representing and manipulating
 * computational graphs in deep learning frameworks. The class provides functionalities for adding nodes, managing their
 * interconnections, and performing forward and backward passes through the network.
 *
 * A computational graph consists of nodes (which represent operations or variables) and edges (which define dependencies
 * between these operations). `ComputeGraph` abstracts the creation and manipulation of these nodes, offering a unified API
 * for building and training deep learning models.
 *
 * Key functionalities provided by the `ComputeGraph` class:
 * - **Node Management**: The class allows for the addition of various types of nodes such as input, output, and computation
 *   nodes (e.g., Add, MatMul, ReLU). Nodes can be connected to form a network.
 * - **Forward/Backward Pass**: The class supports forward and backward propagation through the graph, enabling both
 *   forward inference and backpropagation for gradient computation.
 * - **Topological Sorting**: The graph supports automatic topological sorting to ensure that nodes are executed in the correct
 *   order during the forward and backward passes.
 * - **Gradient and Data Management**: Methods for zeroing gradients, setting input data, and retrieving the output tensor
 *   values.
 * - **Randomization and Initialization**: The class provides functionality to initialize or randomize the parameters of
 *   nodes and their tensors.
 * - **Model Persistence**: Methods to save and load the graph to/from disk, allowing models to be persisted and restored
 *   for later use.
 * - **Optimizer Integration**: The class can interface with various optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) to update the weights of
 *   the nodes during training.
 *
 * **Node Types**:
 * The graph supports several types of nodes, including:
 * - **Computation Nodes**: Operations like addition (`AddNode`), matrix multiplication (`MatMulNode`), and activation
 *   functions (e.g., `ReLUNode`, `SigmoidNode`, `SoftmaxNode`).
 * - **Loss Nodes**: Nodes such as `MeanSquaredErrorNode` and `BinaryCrossEntropyNode` that compute the loss function for
 *   model training.
 * - **Input/Output Nodes**: Nodes to manage input and output data tensors for the model.
 *
 * **Error Handling**:
 * - If a node type is not found or an invalid configuration is provided for creating nodes, appropriate runtime exceptions
 *   are thrown.
 * - Attempts to add incompatible nodes (e.g., scalar nodes) using the `addNode` function will trigger warnings or errors.
 *
 * **Usage Example**:
 * The typical workflow using `ComputeGraph` involves creating nodes, connecting them to form a graph, and performing forward
 * and backward passes to train the model. The `update` function allows optimizers to be applied to update the parameters of
 * the model during training.
 *
 * @note
 * - This class is designed to be GPU-accelerated and is intended to be used in deep learning models where large-scale data
 *   and high computation power are required.
 * - The class provides basic error handling for common issues like missing nodes or invalid node types.

     * - **Graph Management**: The class manages a list of nodes, input nodes, output nodes, and ensures that nodes are
     *   added and connected properly.
     * - **Forward and Backward Passes**: The `forward()` and `backward()` methods execute the forward and backward
     *   computation across all nodes in the graph.
     * - **Topological Sort**: The `topologicalSort()` method sorts the nodes in a way that respects their dependencies,
     *   ensuring that computation happens in the correct order.
     * - **Randomization and Initialization**: The graph supports random initialization of node values via the `randomize()`
     *   and `randomizeAll()` methods.
     * - **Gradient Zeroing**: The `zeroGrad()` method zeros the gradients of all nodes in the graph.
     * - **Saving and Loading**: The `save()` and `load()` methods allow for the persistence of the graphâ€™s state.
     *
     * This class is designed to be used in a computational graph where nodes represent various mathematical operations
     * and tensors represent the data that flows through the graph.

         * Exception handling: This function does not explicitly catch exceptions. If memory allocation for the InputNode fails (`new` throws `std::bad_alloc`), or if there are issues with the `shape` or `data` passed to the InputNode constructor, the exceptions will propagate to the caller.
         *
         * It interacts with the `nodes`, `inputNodes`, `nodeRoster`, and `nodeRosterReverse` members of the ComputeGraph to manage the list of nodes and the mapping between node names and pointers.

         * - The time complexity of this function is O(1) for node creation and O(log m) for insertion into the `nodeRoster` map, where m is the number of nodes in the graph.

         * @brief Adds a node of any type to the computational graph.
         *
         * This template method allows adding a node of any type derived from the `Node` class to the computational graph.
         * The node is added to the `nodes` list and optionally assigned a name. If the name is `"default"`, a unique
         * name is generated using the node's type and a reference counter.
         *
         * @tparam NodeType The type of the node, which must be derived from `Node`.
         * This allows the method to work with different types of nodes (e.g., `InputNode`, `OutputNode`, etc.).
         *
         * @param node A pointer to the node to be added to the graph.
         * @param name The name of the node. If `"default"`, a unique name will be generated. The default value is `"default"`.
         *
         * @return A pointer to the added node.
         *
         * @note
         * - If the `name` is `"default"`, the method generates a unique name for the node by concatenating the node's type
         * and a reference counter (e.g., `Input_1`, `Add_2`).
         * - The node is added to both the `nodes` list (for graph traversal) and the `nodeRoster`/`nodeRosterReverse` maps
         * (for name-based access).
         *
         * ### Usage Example:

         * If the node type or input nodes are invalid, an exception will be thrown.

         * - For "Input" and "Scalar" nodes, the method will print a warning and return `nullptr` because these nodes cannot be added using this method.
         * - If the specified node type requires specific input nodes, the method checks if the input nodes exist in the graph before proceeding.
         * - The method supports variable arguments (`Args... args`) for nodes like LeakyReLU, ELU, and others that may require additional parameters.

         * @brief Performs topological sorting on the computational graph.
         *
         * This function performs topological sorting on the computational graph to order the nodes such that each node
         * appears before any nodes that depend on it. The sorted nodes are stored in the `sortedNodes` vector, which
         * allows for a correct computation order during graph traversal. It uses Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting.
         *
         * @throws std::runtime_error If the graph contains a cycle, indicating that topological sorting is not possible.
         *
         * This method modifies the following member variables:
         * - `sortedNodes`: A vector that stores the nodes in topologically sorted order.
         * - `inDegree`: A map that keeps track of the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node.
         * - `adjList`: A map that stores the adjacency list for each node, representing which nodes depend on it.
         *
         * @note
         * - The function assumes that the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If a cycle is detected during the
         *   sorting process, an exception will be thrown.
         * - This method is useful in scenarios like forward propagation in neural networks, where nodes need to be
         *   processed in a specific order.
         *
         * ### Algorithm Explanation:
         * 1. Initialize the `inDegree` of each node to 0.
         * 2. Build the `adjList` for each node and increment the `inDegree` of nodes that have incoming edges.
         * 3. Initialize a queue with all nodes that have an in-degree of 0 (i.e., no dependencies).
         * 4. Process each node from the queue, adding it to the `sortedNodes` list, and decrement the `inDegree`
         *    of its adjacent nodes (i.e., nodes that depend on it). If any adjacent node's in-degree becomes 0,
         *    it is added to the queue.
         * 5. If the number of nodes in `sortedNodes` does not match the total number of nodes in the graph, a cycle
         *    is detected and an exception is thrown.
         *
         * ### Usage Example:
         * ```cpp
         * ComputeGraph graph;
         * // Add nodes and edges to the graph...
         * graph.topologicalSort();  // Perform topological sorting
         * ```

         * @brief Randomizes the output tensor of a specified node in the computational graph.
         *
         * This method sets the values of the specified node's output tensor to random values using the provided random
         * seed. The method first checks if the node with the given name exists in the graph. If the node exists, it calls
         * the `randomize()` method on the nodeâ€™s output tensor. If the node is not found in the graph, a runtime error is
         * thrown.
         *
         * @param name The name of the node whose output tensor should be randomized.
         * @param seed The seed value for the random number generator. If not provided, the seed defaults to 0.
         *
         * @throw std::runtime_error If the node with the given name is not found in the graph.

         * - The `randomize()` method is expected to be defined for the node's output tensor to set its values randomly.
         * - The method uses the provided `seed` value to ensure reproducibility of the randomization process.
         * - If the node is not found, an error is thrown to inform the user that the node is missing from the graph.

         * The `print` method prints a detailed description of the computational graph, including each node's name,
         * its preceding (input) nodes, following (output) nodes, data, and gradients. If the graph is not sorted,
         * it will automatically perform a topological sort before printing the details. The method assumes that
         * the graph contains at least one output node and prints the loss value of the first output node.
         *
         * @param os The output stream where the graph details will be printed (e.g., `std::cout`).
         * @return The same output stream after printing the graph details, enabling method chaining.
         *
         * @throws std::runtime_error if an error occurs during the process.

         * The method first checks if the graph is sorted. If the graph is not sorted, a runtime error is thrown. If the

         * @note
         * - If the graph is not sorted, a runtime error is thrown because backward propagation relies on the topological
         *   order of the nodes. Sorting ensures that each nodeâ€™s gradient can be computed in the correct order.

         * - If the graph has no output nodes or multiple output nodes, a runtime error is thrown.
         *
         * ### Why Not Automatically Sort the Graph?
         * The `backward()` method does not automatically sort the graph because backward propagation must correspond to a
         * previously completed forward pass. A forward pass determines the order of operations and ensures that the graph is
         * in a valid state for backward propagation. Automatically sorting the graph would interfere with this flow, as
         * backward propagation is dependent on the state of the graph after forward propagation. Hence, the graph is only
         * processed for backward propagation if it has been sorted and the forward pass has already occurred.
         *
         * ### Usage Example:
         * ```cpp
         * ComputeGraph graph;
         * // Assuming nodes are added and the graph is sorted...
         * graph.forward();  // Perform forward propagation first
         * graph.backward(); // Perform backward propagation after forward pass
         * ```
